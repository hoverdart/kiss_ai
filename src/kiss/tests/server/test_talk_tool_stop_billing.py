"""A Stop that lands right after a ``talk`` synthesis still bills it.

October 2026 cost audit: the ``talk`` tool attributed the TTS spend
after a ``try/except Exception``, so a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` (the
daemon's Stop, delivered asynchronously) unwinding through the tool
after ``synthesize_talk_audio`` had already banked its spend in
``usage_out`` discarded that spend with the local dict.  The
attribution now runs in a ``finally``.

The Stop is injected with a real ``KeyboardInterrupt`` raised by a
line tracer at the first line of ``synthesize_talk_audio`` executed
after its own ``finally`` filled ``usage_out`` — the same delivery
model as ``PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc``, pinned to the one window
where the spend is known but not yet attributed.  The synthesis is a
live gpt-audio call (the talk tests already make one).
